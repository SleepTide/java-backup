# Auto Java Backup

This system makes auto backups for your **java** edition server!

Just edit the config file in the *lib/config.ts* to change how this system works. You will need to edit this file for it to begin working!

## Made a while ago, so could break!

# To get started:

To get started just run **npm install** to install the required dependices for this system.
Then run **npm run start** to begin the auto backup system!

It is recommended it run this with **pm2** to make it easier to run in the background!
